Sometimes, it is hard to see trends and to communicate with your audience by only looking at summary statistics. In this notebook, we will import the csv files we saved in the previous two notebooks and learn how to turn them into informative visualizations. We will also discuss visualization options for different types of analyses and how to use labels and plot adjustments to better present your results. Similar to the first two notebooks, as you work through the notebook, we will have checkpoints for you to practice using the code."

It is hard for the audience to see key time points, such as when the number of individuals employed in TX was the highest. Therefore, we want to adjust the x-axis tick so that it shows the time points more frequently. In this case, we use `scale_x_continuous()` and `scale_y_continuous()` to specify a continuous data type and to adjust tick marks and axis extent. In both cases, `breaks=` statement controls the minimum and maximum values of the axis labels as well as the tick mark intervals between them."

However, it is not necessary to add key timepoints to every graph. We can add vertical lines to the graph to represent significant events using the `geom_vline()` statement and control labels for these lines using the `annotate()` statement. Within `geom_vline()` we must specify where to place the line using the `xintercept=` command. In our case, we assign the quarter of highest employment to a variable and then pass this variable to `xintercept=`. When we use the `annotate()` statement, we must specify the location of the labels using the `x=` and `y=` statements. Keep in mind you will likely need to adjust these based on specific details of your graph. In the example below, we use a height of REDACTED, which places the label right above the peak."

Instead, we will use the heatmap as a format by which to map employment patterns, as we will color-code each box depending on if the pattern has or does not have employment in a specific quarter.
