    "Whereas unsupervised machine learning can be used to understand underlying groupings within the data, supervised machine learning focuses on prediction of a certain outcome. With prediction, we will formulate our model based on training data, and then evaluate the results of the model on a separate test set. Similar to unsupervised machine learning, though, before running any algorithm, we must think critically about the features we want to include in our model. The variables we consider as features do not have to be limited to the variables in the provided tables, as there may be features that can be developed by leveraging variables across multiple sources. Additionally, we will want to make sure our input information is in a specific format so that it can be seamlessly used in modeling. This notebook will prepare the training and testing tables and the next notebook will cover prediction algorithms.\n",
