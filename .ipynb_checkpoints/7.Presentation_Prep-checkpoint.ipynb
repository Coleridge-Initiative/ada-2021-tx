    "- Every statistic for export should be based on at least 10 individuals\n",
    "\n",
    "- If wage records are used to generate a file, each statistic must also be based on at least 3 employers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Counts must be rounded - 0-999 to the nearest 10 and above 999 to the nearest 100\n",
    "\n",
    "- Percentages, proportions and ratios need to be rounded - First must apply the rounding rules to both the numerator and denominator, before calculating percentages that must be rounded to the nearest percent and proportions to the nearest hundredth (.01)\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Wages must be rounded to the nearest 100\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exact percentiles can not be exported - Instead, for example, you may calculate a “fuzzy median” by averaging the true 45th and 55th percentiles\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exact maxima and minima can not be exported - You may replace an exact maximum or minimum with a top-coded value\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complementary suppression - If your files include values that are dependent on a separate file, you may need to take into account complementary disclosure risks—that is, whether the file’s values, or a combination of files when read together, might disclose information about less than 10 individuals in the data in a way that a single, simpler table would not. Team facilitators and export reviewers will work with you by offering guidance on implementing any necessary complementary suppression techniques."

Since the median describes the 50th percentile, exporting any tables or visualizations based on medians is not permitted. To get a sense of percentiles in the data, fuzzy percentiles can be exported, which can be created by finding the average of two true percentiles. For example, a fuzzy median can be created by finding the average of the true 45th and 55th percentiles.
