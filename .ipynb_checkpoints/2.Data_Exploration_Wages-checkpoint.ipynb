    "It is generally accepted that individuals and society benefit from higher levels of educational attainment. Postsecondary credentials, in particular, appear to be the keys to individual self-sufficiency, greater civic participation, and higher levels of family well-being and the catalysts for local, regional, and national economic growth. In 2010, economist Anthony Carnevale (2010) referred to access to postsecondary education and training as the \"arbiter of opportunity in America,\" and this statement continues to hold true; the median invididual employed full-time today earns 80 percent more than a similar individual with only a high school diploma. Perhaps more so than ever, success in the labor market requires workers to demonstrate compentencies in thinking critically and applying new skills to ever more complex technology, as well as to demonstrate the ability to learn wholly new skills in short order. Employers benefit from a more highly skilled and productive workforce, and society benefits from increased tax revenue, reduced crime rates and dependence on public assistance programs, and greater civic engagement.

    "Texas is certainly no exception to this general rule. In their analysis of returns to postsecondary attainment in Texas, Murdock et al. (2003) found that for every \\\\$1.00 invested in higher education, the state received more than \\\\$4.00 in returns in terms of reduced public assistance, lower incarceration rates, and increased tax revenue. Similarly, in their study of the return on state investments in workforce services in Texas, King et al. (2008) found an annualized ROI over a 10-year period of 38 percent for participants and 25 percent for taxpayers, with investments in high-itensity services (including postsecondary education up to the associate degree level) yeilding somewhat higher earnings than low-intensity investments).

    "Despite these generally positive findings, it is likely that the issue of the value of a postsecondary credential is considerably more nuanced than simply whether or not one has one. In their analyses of NLSY79 data, Roska and Levy (2010) found \"occupationally specific degrees are beneficial at the point of entry into the labor market but have the lowest growth in occupational status over time. Students earning credentials focusing on general skills, in contrast, begin in jobs with low occupational status but subsequently report the greatest growth.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "These mixed findings suggest that there are many unanswered questions regarding state-level investments in postsecondary education and training: how is the value defined for and attributed to education and training certificates and credentials; what role, if any, does prior work experience play in determining education and training-related labor market outcomes; how do these outcomes differ by race, gender, family income quartile, etc., plus a host of others.

Particularly because we will need to link our original cohort to the UI wage records to begin to understand the cohort's employment outcomes, we saved our resulting analytical file formed at the end of Notebook 1 as a table in SQL. This will allow us to easily perform a linkage to the cohort's employment outcomes in SQL, as opposed to reading the entire UI wage records table into R to perform the linkage. Once we have our final table of wage outcomes specific to our cohort within a defined time period, we should be able to read this table into R to perform more complex analyses, as it is just a small subset of the original UI wage records file.\n",

    "Now that we have successfully created the `job_date` variable and evaluated the wage records for potential duplication, we can follow a relatively similar process for generating `grad_date`. There are a couple of columns you can use from the `grads15` table. One option is a combination of `gradmonth`, which tracks the month of graduation, and `gradyear`, the year of graduation. However, as discussed in the first notebook, `gradyear` is actually the fiscal year of graduation, not the calendar year. Luckily, though, we know that the calendar year for all of these graduates is 2015 due to our original cohort contruction."

To create `grad_date`, we need to manipulate `gradmonth` to correspond to the first day of the proper fiscal quarter to ensure that it will align with `job_date`. Here, we will consider the first month of the Fall semester to correspond to October 1, or the first day of the 4th fiscal quarter; we will consider the first month of the Spring semester to correspond to April 1, and the first month of the Summer semester to July 1.
