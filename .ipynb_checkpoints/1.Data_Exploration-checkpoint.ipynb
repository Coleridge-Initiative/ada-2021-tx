    "This notebook introduces you to the concept of creating a group, or \"cohort\", that will be used for future analysis. We will construct measures to understand who we are including and excluding (coverage) from the cohort and walk you through the decisions that need to be made when devising the cohort using filters such as award level, gender, major, and others. Cohorts define the primary population of interest in much research; once created, cohorts may then be used to link to other data sources.\n",

    "   + Higher education completers (*THECB graduations file*) \n",

    "We begin by introducing you to data analytics tools to access the data, including connecting R to the server and using SQL queries to pull the data. We will then leverage these tools to explore the graduations file from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB). To train you in creating a cohort, we will create a dataset (called a \"data frame\") and investigate trends in Texas college graduates. At the end of this notebook, we will save the summary statistics to csv files so that we can use them in subsequent notebooks."
